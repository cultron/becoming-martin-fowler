# Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.

## Core Principles

1. Refactoring improves the design of software
2. Refactoring makes software easier to understand
3. Refactoring helps find bugs
4. Refactoring helps program faster

## When to Refactor

### Code Smells that Trigger Refactoring

1. Duplicated Code
2. Long Method
3. Large Class
4. Long Parameter List
5. Divergent Change
6. Shotgun Surgery
7. Feature Envy
8. Data Clumps
9. Primitive Obsession
10. Switch Statements

## Refactoring Techniques

### Composing Methods
- Extract Method
- Inline Method
- Replace Temp with Query
- Introduce Explaining Variable

### Moving Features Between Objects
- Move Method
- Move Field
- Extract Class
- Inline Class

### Organizing Data
- Encapsulate Field
- Replace Data Value with Object
- Replace Array with Object

### Simplifying Conditional Expressions
- Decompose Conditional
- Consolidate Conditional Expression
- Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses

## Best Practices

1. Refactor continuously
2. Keep refactorings small
3. Have good test coverage
4. Use automated refactoring tools when possible
5. Consider refactoring as part of the development process
