# Refactoring Practices

## Core Principles

### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in a way that:
- Does not alter the external behavior
- Improves its internal structure
- Makes it easier to understand and modify

### When to Refactor

1. Code Smells
   - Duplicated code
   - Long methods
   - Large classes
   - Feature envy
   - Data clumps

2. Adding Features
   - Prepare code for new features
   - Make patterns more obvious
   - Improve understanding

3. Bug Fixing
   - Clarify code structure
   - Make bugs more visible
   - Prevent future bugs

## Common Refactorings

### Method-Level Refactorings

1. Extract Method
   - Create new method
   - Move code from old location
   - Replace old code with call

2. Rename Method
   - Choose better name
   - Update all callers
   - Maintain meaning

3. Move Method
   - Relocate to better class
   - Update references
   - Consider dependencies

### Class-Level Refactorings

1. Extract Class
   - Identify related features
   - Create new class
   - Move relevant members

2. Move Field
   - Relocate data
   - Update accessors
   - Maintain encapsulation

3. Replace Inheritance with Delegation
   - Remove inheritance
   - Add delegation
   - Maintain interface

## Testing and Safety

### Refactoring Safety

1. Small Steps
   - One change at a time
   - Keep code working
   - Commit frequently

2. Tests First
   - Strong test suite
   - Quick feedback
   - Regression prevention

3. IDE Support
   - Automated refactorings
   - Quick fixes
   - Code analysis

## Best Practices

1. Regular Maintenance
   - Continuous refactoring
   - Boy Scout rule
   - Technical debt management

2. Team Communication
   - Share patterns
   - Code reviews
   - Pair programming

3. Documentation
   - Comment reasons
   - Update docs
   - Maintain history
