# Distributed Systems Patterns

## Core Patterns

### 1. Consistency Patterns

#### Leader and Followers
- Single leader for writes
- Multiple followers for reads
- Replication strategies
- Failover mechanisms

#### Quorum-based Decisions
- Write quorum
- Read quorum
- Consistency levels
- Network partitions

### 2. Communication Patterns

#### Request-Response
- Synchronous communication
- Timeout handling
- Retry strategies
- Circuit breakers

#### Event-Based
- Asynchronous messaging
- Event sourcing
- Message queues
- Publish-subscribe

### 3. State Management

#### Distributed State
- State replication
- Conflict resolution
- Version vectors
- CRDTs

#### Caching
- Cache invalidation
- Cache coherence
- Cache strategies
- Distributed caching

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Fault Tolerance

#### Failure Detection
- Heartbeat mechanisms
- Failure detectors
- Health checks
- Monitoring

#### Recovery
- State recovery
- Log replay
- Snapshot recovery
- Incremental recovery

### 2. High Availability

#### Replication
- Active-passive
- Active-active
- Multi-master
- Geographic distribution

#### Load Distribution
- Load balancing
- Partitioning
- Sharding
- Consistent hashing

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles

- Plan for failure
- Keep it simple
- Make it observable
- Build in redundancy

### 2. Implementation Guidelines

- Use proven patterns
- Test extensively
- Monitor everything
- Document decisions

### 3. Operational Considerations

- Deployment strategies
- Monitoring setup
- Incident response
- Capacity planning
