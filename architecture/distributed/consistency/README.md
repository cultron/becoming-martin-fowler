# Distributed Systems Consistency

## Consistency Models

### 1. Strong Consistency

#### Linearizability
- Single-copy consistency
- Real-time ordering
- Implementation challenges
- Performance impact

#### Sequential Consistency
- Program order preservation
- Global ordering
- Implementation approaches
- Use cases

### 2. Weak Consistency

#### Eventual Consistency
- Background
- Convergence properties
- Conflict resolution
- Application patterns

#### Causal Consistency
- Causal relationships
- Vector clocks
- Implementation strategies
- Trade-offs

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Data Replication

#### Synchronous Replication
- Strong consistency
- Performance impact
- Failure handling
- Recovery processes

#### Asynchronous Replication
- Eventual consistency
- Performance benefits
- Conflict resolution
- Monitoring and alerts

### 2. Consensus Protocols

#### Paxos
- Basic algorithm
- Multi-Paxos
- Implementation challenges
- Practical considerations

#### Raft
- Leader election
- Log replication
- Safety properties
- Implementation guidance

## Practical Considerations

### 1. Choosing Consistency Levels

- Business requirements
- Performance needs
- Availability requirements
- Operational complexity

### 2. Implementation Strategies

- Technology selection
- Monitoring approaches
- Testing strategies
- Deployment considerations

### 3. Common Challenges

- Network partitions
- Split brain scenarios
- Data conflicts
- Performance issues
