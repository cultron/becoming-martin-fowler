# Software Architecture

This section contains Martin Fowler's key insights and patterns related to software architecture, organized by major themes.

## What is Architecture?

According to Martin Fowler, architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is. This seemingly simple definition carries deep meaning:

- Architecture comprises the design decisions that significantly impact the system
- What's "important" varies by context and system
- Good architecture supports its own evolution
- Architecture is deeply intertwined with programming, not separate from it

## Why Architecture Matters

- Poor architecture leads to accumulation of technical debt ("cruft")
- Good architecture enables faster delivery of new features
- While sacrificing quality can speed up delivery in the short term, it typically slows down development within weeks
- Architecture quality pays off much sooner than most people expect

## Core Architectural Areas

1. [Application Architecture](./application/README.md)
   - Boundaries and social construction of applications
   - GUI architectures and patterns
   - Layering strategies (Presentation-Domain-Data)
   - Feature toggles and deployment strategies

2. [Enterprise Architecture](./enterprise/README.md)
   - Integration patterns
   - Legacy system modernization
   - Organizational aspects
   - Strategic technical direction

3. [Microservices](./microservices/README.md)
   - Architectural patterns
   - Implementation strategies
   - Migration approaches
   - Frontend considerations

4. [Distributed Systems](./distributed/README.md)
   - Common patterns
   - Synchronization strategies
   - Consistency models
   - Failure handling

## Key Principles

1. Good architecture enables evolution
2. Architecture is about making important decisions
3. What's important varies by context
4. Architecture should support its own evolution
5. Architecture is intertwined with development, not separate
