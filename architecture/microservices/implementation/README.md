# Implementing Microservices

## Key Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility

Each microservice should:
- Have a clear, focused purpose
- Own its domain logic
- Maintain its own data
- Present clear interfaces

### 2. Service Autonomy

- Independent deployment
- Independent scaling
- Independent failure
- Independent evolution

### 3. Data Management

- Private persistence
- Event-driven updates
- Eventual consistency
- CQRS when appropriate

## Technical Considerations

### Service Design

1. API Design
   - RESTful principles
   - Clear contracts
   - Version management
   - Error handling

2. Data Storage
   - Database per service
   - Polyglot persistence
   - Data duplication strategies
   - Consistency patterns

3. Service Communication
   - Synchronous vs Asynchronous
   - Event sourcing
   - Message queues
   - API gateways

### Operational Aspects

1. Deployment
   - Containerization
   - Orchestration
   - Service discovery
   - Load balancing

2. Monitoring
   - Distributed tracing
   - Centralized logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Health checks

3. Security
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Network security
   - Data protection

## Best Practices

1. Start with Monolith
   - Understand domain first
   - Extract services gradually
   - Learn from experience

2. Define Clear Boundaries
   - Business capabilities
   - Data ownership
   - Team responsibilities

3. Automate Everything
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Infrastructure as code
   - Testing
   - Monitoring

4. Plan for Failure
   - Circuit breakers
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Resilience patterns
   - Recovery strategies
