# Microservices Patterns

## Core Patterns

### 1. Service Independence

Each microservice should be:
- Independently deployable
- Independently scalable
- Owned by a single team
- Built around business capabilities

### 2. Data Management

- Each service owns its data
- Database per service pattern
- Event-driven data updates
- Eventual consistency between services

### 3. Communication Patterns

- Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
- Asynchronous (Message Queues)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- API Gateway pattern

### 4. Deployment Patterns

- Container-based deployment
- Service discovery
- Circuit breakers
- Load balancing

## Implementation Considerations

### Frontend Integration

Micro frontends approach:
- Decompose frontend like backend
- Independent deployment
- Team autonomy
- Technology flexibility

### Testing Strategies

1. Unit Testing
   - Service-level testing
   - Fast feedback

2. Integration Testing
   - Service interaction
   - Contracts

3. End-to-End Testing
   - Critical paths
   - User journeys

### Monitoring and Observability

1. Centralized Logging
2. Distributed Tracing
3. Health Checks
4. Performance Metrics

## Migration Strategies

### From Monolith to Microservices

1. Strangler Fig Pattern
   - Gradually replace functionality
   - Keep monolith running
   - Incremental approach

2. Branch by Abstraction
   - Abstract interfaces
   - Gradual implementation
   - Safe refactoring

### Common Pitfalls

1. Premature Decomposition
2. Inappropriate Service Boundaries
3. Distributed Monolith
4. Inadequate Monitoring
5. Ignoring Data Consistency
