# Microservices Architecture

## Definition

Microservices is an architectural style where a single application is developed as a suite of small services, each:
- Running in its own process
- Communicating via lightweight mechanisms (often HTTP/REST)
- Built around business capabilities
- Independently deployable

## Key Characteristics

1. Service Characteristics
   - Independently deployable
   - Loosely coupled
   - Organized around business capabilities
   - Own their own data

2. Organizational Aspects
   - Decentralized governance
   - Decentralized data management
   - Infrastructure automation
   - Design for failure

## Implementation Patterns

### Service Design

1. Service Boundaries
   - Business domain alignment
   - Data ownership
   - Interface design

2. Communication Patterns
   - Synchronous vs Asynchronous
   - Event-driven architectures
   - API design

### Data Management

1. Database per Service
   - Data isolation
   - Technology diversity
   - Consistency considerations

2. Distributed Transactions
   - Saga pattern
   - Eventual consistency
   - Compensation strategies

## Frontend Considerations

### Micro Frontends

1. Benefits
   - Independent deployment
   - Technical flexibility
   - Team autonomy

2. Implementation Approaches
   - Build-time integration
   - Run-time integration
   - Server-side composition

## Best Practices

1. Start with monolith
2. Design around business capabilities
3. Automate deployment
4. Implement robust monitoring
5. Plan for failure
